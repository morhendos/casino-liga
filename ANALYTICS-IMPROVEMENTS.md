## Authentication Fixes

To resolve the 401 Unauthorized errors in the player analytics section:

1. **Created new API endpoint**: Implemented the missing `/api/players/leagues` endpoint that serves player data filtered by league ID
2. **Added authentication checks**: Ensured proper session validation in the API route
3. **Enhanced error handling**:
   - Added specific detection for 401 errors
   - Implemented user-friendly error messages
   - Added retry functionality with a button for easy recovery

## Progress Bar Improvements

To fix the issue where progress bars were not visually distinguishable:

1. **Enhanced Progress component**:
   - Changed background color to have better contrast with the indicator
   - Added variant support (default, success, info) for different contexts
   - Used explicit slate colors for better visibility in both light and dark modes
2. **Applied in components**:
   - Updated LeagueStatsDashboard with new Progress variants
   - Improved PlayerPerformanceCard with better contrasting Progress bars
   - Maintained consistent color scheme across the application
   - Added conditional styling based on data values (e.g., success variant when above average)

## Match Result Form Fixes

To fix the React warnings about uncontrolled inputs and DOM nesting:

1. **Added score value helper function**:
   - Created `getScoreStringValue()` function to ensure consistent string representations
   - Properly handled the case of zero values vs. empty inputs
   - Ensured inputs are always treated as controlled components with defined values
   - Added comprehensive null/undefined checks to prevent runtime errors

2. **Improved DOM structure in dialogs**:
   - Restructured the confirmation dialog layout to follow HTML nesting standards
   - Separated `div` elements from `p` elements to avoid nesting violations
   - Maintained consistent visual design while fixing underlying structure
   - Improved accessibility for assistive technologies

## Code Quality Improvements

Throughout the codebase, we've made various enhancements to improve overall quality:

1. **Defensive programming**:
   - Added null/undefined checks throughout the codebase
   - Used optional chaining and nullish coalescing where appropriate
   - Implemented fallback defaults for all potentially undefined values

2. **Error handling**:
   - Enhanced error handling with specific error types and messages
   - Improved user feedback for error states
   - Added retry mechanisms for recoverable errors

3. **Type safety**:
   - Improved TypeScript typing across components
   - Added explicit type conversions where needed
   - Ensured consistent type handling for values that cross API boundaries

## Future Improvements

Areas for further enhancement:

1. Implement Excel (XLSX) export functionality
2. Add PDF report generation
3. Expand player analytics with more detailed metrics
4. Add data visualization charts for league statistics
5. Implement team comparison feature
6. Improve authentication flow with better session persistence
7. Add more visual indicators for important metrics
8. Implement accessibility improvements for screen readers
9. Add more comprehensive end-to-end testing
