## Authentication Fixes

To resolve the 401 Unauthorized errors in the player analytics section:

1. **Created new API endpoint**: Implemented the missing `/api/players/leagues` endpoint that serves player data filtered by league ID
2. **Added authentication checks**: Ensured proper session validation in the API route
3. **Enhanced error handling**:
   - Added specific detection for 401 errors
   - Implemented user-friendly error messages
   - Added retry functionality with a button for easy recovery

## Progress Bar Improvements

To fix the issue where progress bars were not visually distinguishable:

1. **Enhanced Progress component**:
   - Changed background color to have better contrast with the indicator
   - Added variant support (default, success, info) for different contexts
   - Used explicit slate colors for better visibility in both light and dark modes
2. **Applied in components**:
   - Updated LeagueStatsDashboard with new Progress variants
   - Improved PlayerPerformanceCard with better contrasting Progress bars
   - Maintained consistent color scheme across the application
   - Added conditional styling based on data values (e.g., success variant when above average)

## Match Result Form Fixes

To fix the React warning about uncontrolled to controlled inputs:

1. **Added score value helper function**:
   - Created `getScoreStringValue()` function to ensure consistent string representations
   - Properly handled the case of zero values vs. empty inputs
   - Ensured inputs are always treated as controlled components with defined values
2. **Improved type handling**:
   - Maintained correct type conversion between number and string values
   - Avoided undefined values that could trigger React warnings

2. Add PDF report generation
3. Expand player analytics with more detailed metrics
4. Add data visualization charts for league statistics
5. Implement team comparison feature
6. Improve authentication flow with better session persistence
