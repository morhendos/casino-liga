# Button Enhancements

This branch contains enhanced hover effects for the buttons in the header, with a particular focus on the "Iniciar Sesión" button.

## Changes

### Login Button Changes
- Replaced the standard LogIn icon with a custom geometric design (nested squares) that better matches the angular aesthetic of the Padeliga logo
- Added concentric ring effects that appear on hover, creating a ripple-like visual that emphasizes the geometric design language
- Implemented diagonal stripe overlays that add depth and movement to the hover state
- Added angular corner accents that emerge from the corners on hover
- Created a pulsing ring animation that activates on hover for additional visual interest

### Technical Implementation
- All hover effects use CSS transitions and transformations for smooth animations
- Used the existing `pulse-slow` animation from the Tailwind config
- Maintained the teal color scheme for brand consistency
- Ensured mobile responsiveness for all effects
- Used nested divs with absolute positioning to create layered effects

### Visual Design Principles
- Emphasized angular, geometric shapes to align with the logo aesthetics
- Used semi-transparent overlays to create depth without overwhelming the button text
- Maintained a clean, professional appearance while adding visual interest
- Created a sense of "activation" when hovering to improve user feedback

## Testing
To test these changes:
1. Hover over the "Iniciar Sesión" button in the header
2. Note the geometric effects that appear from the edges
3. Observe the concentric rings and pulsing animation
4. Test on mobile view to ensure the effects translate well to touch devices
