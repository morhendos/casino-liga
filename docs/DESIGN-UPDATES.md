# UI Design Enhancements

This document outlines the design principles and specific changes implemented to enhance the Padeliga platform's visual identity and user experience.

## Design Principles

The UI redesign is centered around the following core principles:

1. **Brand Consistency**: All UI elements are aligned with the Padeliga logo's aesthetic.
2. **Solid Colors**: Replaced gradients with solid colors from the logo palette.
3. **Angular Geometry**: Removed rounded corners in favor of straight edges that match the logo's style.
4. **Enhanced Geometric Elements**: Background shapes echo the logo's angular style.
5. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: Better organization of content with clearer emphasis on key elements.
6. **Component Reusability**: Creation of reusable components to ensure design consistency.

## Color System

The color system has been updated to use solid colors directly from the logo palette:

- **Teal** (`hsl(210, 79%, 46%)`): Primary color, used for main UI elements and branding.
- **Orange** (`hsl(37, 91%, 55%)`): Used for CTAs, highlights, and accent elements.
- **Purple** (`hsl(278, 65%, 56%)`): Used for secondary elements and visual variety.
- **Green** (`hsl(84, 67%, 58%)`): Used for success states and positive indicators.
- **Red** (`hsl(350, 73%, 65%)`): Used for warnings, errors, and attention-grabbing elements.
