# Design Update Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the design updates made to align the UI with the Padeliga logo's aesthetic. The changes focus on maintaining visual consistency with the logo's design language.

## Logo Integration

- The Padeliga logo has been properly integrated throughout the application
- Logo sizing has been adjusted to fit different contexts
- Removed redundant "TU LIGA. TU JUEGO." text since it's already in the logo

## Color System

We've adopted the color palette directly from the logo:

- **Teal** (`hsl(210, 79%, 46%)`) - Primary color for buttons and highlights
- **Orange** (`hsl(37, 91%, 55%)`) - Used for CTAs and accent elements
- **Purple** (`hsl(278, 65%, 56%)`) - For secondary elements and status indicators
- **Green** (`hsl(84, 67%, 58%)`) - For success states and specific UI elements
- **Red** (`hsl(350, 73%, 65%)`) - For warnings, errors, and special highlights

## Design Principles Aligned with Logo

### Solid Colors vs. Gradients

- Removed all gradient elements
- Replaced with solid colors that match the logo's palette
- Maintained color opacity/transparency for visual depth

### Geometric Shapes

- Added geometric background elements that echo the logo's style
- Used overlapping shapes with appropriate opacity
- Maintained angular design elements consistent with the logo

### Straight Edges

- Removed rounded corners throughout the design
- Set `--radius: 0` in the theme to keep elements square/rectangular
- Maintained crisp edges similar to the logo design

## Component Updates

### Buttons

- Updated button variants to use solid colors from the logo
- Removed rounded corners
- Added a special "cta" variant for primary call-to-action buttons

### Cards

- Removed gradient borders
- Added solid color highlight options
- Removed rounded corners
- Maintained hover effects for interactivity

### Badges

- Updated to use solid colors that match the logo
- Removed rounded corners
- Kept subtle variants with transparent backgrounds

## Page Updates

### Landing Page

- Updated hero section with properly sized logo
- Replaced gradient CTA button with solid orange
- Changed the "Â¿Listo para comenzar?" section to use solid orange background
- Enhanced geometric background elements

### Public League Pages

- Updated header and card components to use solid colors
- Adjusted badges to use colors from the logo
- Maintained visual consistency with straight edges

## Implementation Notes

1. **CSS Variables**: Added logo colors as CSS variables for consistent usage
2. **Border Radius**: Set to 0 to match the logo's straight edges
3. **Color Consistency**: Ensured all color usage comes from the logo palette

## Future Considerations

- Further refinement of geometric shapes to more closely match logo styling
- Potential development of custom icon set that follows the same design language
- Animation enhancements that maintain the geometric visual language
