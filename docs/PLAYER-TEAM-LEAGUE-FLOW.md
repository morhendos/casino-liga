For players who need to access the platform:

4. **Account is linked**: The new user account is automatically linked to the player profile

## Notes and Best Practices

1. **Player creation**: You can create players without email addresses if they don't need platform access
2. **Team composition**: Teams can have 1-2 players, typically 2 for padel leagues
3. **League settings**: Set appropriate registration deadlines and schedule dates
4. **Team visibility**: Teams will be visible in the league details page after adding

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the player-team-league management:

1. **Players not appearing**: Try refreshing the player list or checking the search filter
2. **Teams not appearing in league**: Refresh the page or check the league details
3. **League management not visible**: Ensure you have admin permissions

## Next Steps
