# League Deletion Feature Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing a feature that allows administrators to delete leagues they have created in the Casino Liga application. League deletion is a sensitive operation that requires careful implementation to prevent data loss, ensure proper permissions, and maintain application integrity.

## Feature Requirements

1. **Admin Access Only**: Only users with admin role can delete leagues
2. **Creator Restriction**: Admin users can only delete leagues they created or have explicit ownership of
3. **Confirmation Required**: Multi-step confirmation to prevent accidental deletions
4. **Data Cascade Options**: Ability to choose whether to preserve or delete related data
5. **Audit Trail**: Record of deletion activity for administrative tracking
6. **Rollback Option**: Temporary soft-delete with option to restore (time-limited)

## UI/UX Implementation

### League Details Page Integration

1. **Delete Button Placement**:
   - Add a "Delete League" button in the league management section
   - Use a destructive (red) variant of the button to indicate dangerous action
   - Position away from commonly used actions to prevent accidental clicks

2. **Confirmation Dialog**:
   - Implement a multi-step confirmation dialog
   - First step: General warning about deletion
   - Second step: Data impact summary (number of teams, matches, etc.)
   - Final step: Require typing league name to confirm deletion

3. **Data Cascade Options**:
   - Provide checkboxes for data handling options:
     - [ ] Delete all associated matches
     - [ ] Delete teams created specifically for this league
     - [ ] Delete player-team associations
     - [ ] Preserve historical data in read-only archive

4. **Status Feedback**:
   - Loading state during deletion process
   - Success notification with temporary undo option
   - Error handling with specific recovery instructions

## Backend Implementation

### API Endpoints

1. **Delete League Endpoint**:
   ```
   DELETE /api/leagues/{id}
   ```
   - Request body parameters for cascade options
   - Returns success/failure status with specific error codes

2. **Validation Endpoint**:
   ```
   POST /api/leagues/{id}/validate-deletion
   ```
   - Pre-validates deletion request
   - Returns impact assessment (related data counts)
   - Performs permission checks before actual deletion

3. **Restore Endpoint** (for rollback):
   ```
   POST /api/leagues/{id}/restore
   ```
   - Available for a limited time after deletion
   - Restores a soft-deleted league and its connections

### Data Operations

1. **Permission Checks**:
   - Verify user has admin role
   - Confirm user is creator/owner of the league
   - Check for any locks or protective flags on the league

2. **Data Relationship Handling**:
   - Identify all dependent data (teams, matches, rankings, etc.)
   - Create a transaction-like operation sequence
   - Prepare rollback steps for each operation

3. **Deletion Strategies**:
   - **Soft Delete**: Set `isDeleted` flag and removal timestamp
   - **Hard Delete**: Physical removal from database
   - **Cascading Delete**: Remove all dependent entities
   - **Archiving**: Move to archive collection with read-only flag

4. **Database Queries**:
   ```typescript
   // Soft delete implementation
   await LeagueModel.findByIdAndUpdate(leagueId, {
     isDeleted: true,
     deletedAt: new Date(),
     deletedBy: userId,
     // Metadata for potential restoration
     deletionMetadata: {
       cascadeOptions,
       affectedEntities
     }
   });
   
   // If cascading deletion is selected
   if (cascadeOptions.deleteMatches) {
     await MatchModel.updateMany(
       { league: leagueId },
       { isDeleted: true, deletedAt: new Date() }
     );
   }
   
   // Similar operations for teams, rankings, etc.
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization Checks**:
   - Multi-level permission verification
   - Rate limiting for deletion operations
   - Session verification for sensitive operations

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Backup key data before deletion
   - Store deletion metadata securely
   - Implement deletion logs for audit purposes

3. **Validation Rules**:
   - Prevent deletion of active leagues with ongoing matches
   - Require explicit confirmation for leagues with significant data
   - Implement cooling-off period for large leagues

## Implementation Steps

1. **Planning and Design** (1-2 days):
   - [ ] Finalize UI wireframes for deletion flow
   - [ ] Create data flow diagrams for deletion process
   - [ ] Define database schema changes for soft deletion

2. **Backend Implementation** (2-3 days):
   - [ ] Create validation endpoint for pre-deletion checks
   - [ ] Implement deletion endpoint with cascade options
   - [ ] Add restoration endpoint and mechanism
   - [ ] Write security middleware for permission checks

3. **Frontend Implementation** (2-3 days):
   - [ ] Add delete button to league management UI
   - [ ] Create multi-step confirmation dialog component
   - [ ] Implement data impact summary display
   - [ ] Add status and error handling for deletion process

4. **Testing** (1-2 days):
   - [ ] Unit tests for deletion logic
   - [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
   - [ ] UI testing for confirmation flow
   - [ ] Authorization tests for security rules

5. **Documentation and Refinement** (1 day):
   - [ ] Update admin documentation with deletion instructions
   - [ ] Create internal documentation for data handling
   - [ ] Add warning notices in relevant UI sections

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests

1. **Permission Validation**:
   - Test admin access requirements
   - Test creator/owner validation
   - Test special cases (protected leagues)

2. **Data Operations**:
   - Test soft delete functionality
   - Test cascade delete options
   - Test data integrity after deletion
   - Test restoration functionality

### Integration Tests

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - Test validation endpoint responses
   - Test deletion endpoint with various options
   - Test error handling and status codes
   - Test restoration endpoint functionality

2. **Data Consistency**:
   - Test database state after deletions
   - Test relationship integrity
   - Test query filtering of deleted items

### UI/UX Tests

1. **Confirmation Flow**:
   - Test multi-step confirmation process
   - Test name verification mechanism
   - Test options selection behavior

2. **Feedback and Status**:
   - Test loading states during operation
   - Test success/error notifications
   - Test undo functionality timing

## Rollout Plan

1. **Phased Implementation**:
   - Start with soft-delete only
   - Add cascade options after validation
   - Enable hard delete after thorough testing

2. **Admin Training**:
   - Provide documentation on proper usage
   - Highlight potential risks and precautions
   - Offer guidance on data management best practices

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Add enhanced logging for deletion operations
   - Monitor deletion frequency and patterns
   - Track any restoration requests

## Future Enhancements

1. **Scheduled Deletion**:
   - Allow scheduling league deletion for future date
   - Send reminders before scheduled deletion
   - Auto-cancel if league becomes active again

2. **Batch Operations**:
   - Enable deletion of multiple inactive leagues
   - Provide filtering tools for bulk management
   - Implement advanced impact assessment

3. **Archive Access**:
   - Create read-only archive view for deleted leagues
   - Allow exporting historical data before deletion
   - Implement selective data preservation

## Conclusion

The league deletion feature will provide administrators with the necessary control over the lifecycle of leagues while ensuring data integrity and preventing accidental data loss. By implementing a careful balance of security, user experience, and data management, this feature will enhance the administrative capabilities of the Casino Liga application.
