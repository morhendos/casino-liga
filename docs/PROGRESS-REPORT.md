# Role-Based Access Implementation Progress Report

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the role-based access control implementation, with a focus on the admin workflow for managing players, teams, and leagues. It outlines what has been implemented, the current architecture, and the next steps for completion.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Data Models & Database Structure

- **Player Model Enhancements**:
  - Added `email` field for admin-created players
  - Added `status` field to track player states ("invited", "active", "inactive")
  - Added invitation tracking fields (`invitationSent`, `invitationToken`, `invitationExpires`)
  - Added validation to ensure either `userId` or `email` is provided

- **User Model Enhancements**:
  - Ensured email is used as unique identifier
  - Added `invitedPlayerId` to link pre-created player accounts
  - Added role-based access control fields and methods

- **Relationships**:
  - User → Player (one-to-one)
  - Player → Teams (many-to-many)
  - Teams → Leagues (many-to-many)

### 2. Services

- **Email Service (`src/lib/services/email-service.ts`)**:
  - Created service for sending invitation emails
  - Currently logs emails instead of sending them (ready for email provider integration)
  - Includes methods for player status updates after invitation

- **Invitation Service (`src/lib/services/invitation-service.ts`)**:
  - Handles invitation token generation and validation
  - Manages invitation expiration dates
  - Provides methods for clearing invitation data after registration

### 3. API Endpoints

- **Admin Player Management**:
  - `/api/admin/players` - CRUD operations for player management
  - `/api/admin/players/[id]/invite` - Endpoint for sending invitations

- **Invitation Processing**:
  - `/api/auth/invite` (GET) - Validates invitation tokens
  - `/api/auth/invite` (POST) - Handles user registration from invitations

- **League and Team Management**:
  - Standard league and team endpoints enhanced with role-based access

### 4. User Interface Components

- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Added role-based access control to restrict access
  - Created tabbed interface for different admin functions

- **Player Invitation Management**:
  - Created `PlayerInvitationManagement.tsx` component
  - Provides UI for creating new players
  - Includes functionality to send invitations
  - Shows lists of invitable, invited, and active players

- **Invitation Registration**:
  - Created dedicated page for handling invitation registrations
  - Validates tokens on page load
  - Provides UI for creating account and linking to existing player

## Current Architecture

The implementation follows a layered architecture:

1. **Data Layer**: MongoDB models with Mongoose for schema validation
2. **Service Layer**: Dedicated services for business logic (invitation, email)
3. **API Layer**: NextJS API routes for data access and operations
4. **UI Layer**: React components for admin and user interfaces

The system uses a token-based invitation flow:
1. Admin creates player → System generates invitation token
2. Admin sends invitation → Email with token link is sent (currently simulated)
3. Player clicks link → Token validates and pre-fills registration
4. Player completes registration → User account links to existing player

## Next Steps

### 1. Email Provider Integration

- Integrate with a real email service provider (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
- Replace the current logging with actual email sending
- Add email templates for invitations
- Configure environment variables for email settings

### 2. Component Integration

- Complete integration between league management and player/team components
- Ensure player invitations can be sent directly from league management
- Add team formation within league context

### 3. Testing

- Add unit tests for invitation services
- Create integration tests for the invitation flow
- Test edge cases like expired tokens, email duplicates, etc.

### 4. Enhanced Features

- Add ability to resend invitations
- Implement better tracking of invitation status
- Add bulk invitation capability for multiple players
- Add email notification for league assignments

### 5. UI Refinements

- Improve error handling and messaging
- Add confirmation dialogs for important actions
- Enhance mobile responsiveness
- Add loading states for async operations

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. The email service currently only logs emails and doesn't actually send them
2. No integration tests for the end-to-end invitation flow
3. Limited error handling for edge cases
4. No bulk operations for inviting multiple players at once

## Conclusion

The role-based access control implementation has made significant progress, with most of the core functionality now in place. The system provides a solid foundation for admin-driven player management and league organization. The remaining work is focused on integration with real services, testing, and user experience refinements.

The admin workflow now enables the creation of players, sending invitations, and managing leagues - fulfilling the core requirements of the original proposal.
